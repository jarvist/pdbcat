			PDBCAT

Intro:

  The Brookhaven Protein Data Bank stores atomic coordinate information
for protein structures in a column based format.  This is designed to
be read easily read by FORTRAN programs.  Indeed, if you get the
format description (from anonymous ftp to ftp.pdb.bnl.gov, the file
/pub/format.desc.ps) they show the single input line needed to read
each record type.
  However, I am a C/C++ programmer in the Unix environment.  It is a
easier for me to deal with field based input than column based ones.
If the fields are white space delimited I can easily use awk and perl
to manipulate the coordinate information.  So I needed some way to
convert the ATOM and HETATM records of PDB files from the standard
column based format to a field based one and back again.  It needed
to denote missing fields if they exist.
  That converter is `pdbcat'.

Usage:

pdbcat {-fields | -columns} [[-f] files]

  Read any pdb file from stdin or list of files and convert the
 data to either a column based or field based pdb file.  A '#'
 represents an empty field.  This is useful for field based 
 tools like awk.  The default output is 'columns'.

How to Install:
  1) uncompress and untar the source

% cat pdbcat_1.tar.Z | uncompress | tar -xf -

  2) change to the pdbcat directory and run make

% cd pdbcat; make

  3) If it complains about not finding CC, then you'll
have to edit the Makefile and set CC equal to your local
C++ compilier, for instance, for gcc:

CC=gcc

  4) If there is a problem with strcasecmp, uncomment the
following line in the Makefile:

#DEF = -DNOSTRCASECMP

    update the time stamp on the file Common.C

% touch Common.C

    and run make again

Warning:

 This does not actually parse the PDB format.  Instead, it parses the
X-PLOR variant.  This variant has a 4 column (instead of 3 column)
residue name field, and a special "segment name" field from 
columns 73 to 76.  While X-PLOR ignores the 1 character "chain
identifier", this program does not.

Examples:

Here are some examples of pdbcat combined with awk.

Find the centroid:

% pdbcat -fields polio.pdb | awk '{num++; x+=$10; y+=$11; z+=$12} 
     END {print "Centroid is:", x/num, y/num, z/num}'
Centroid is: 31.0427 37.0688 120.05


Move the data by a certain amount

(in this case, -31.0427 -37.0688 -120.05) Special note, the print statement by itself
prints the whole line. Also note that I can change a field by just as if it was a varable. 

% head -3 polio.pdb
ATOM      1  HT1 GLY     6       8.960  50.028  85.307  1.00   .00      VP1 
ATOM      2  HT2 GLY     6       8.912  51.471  86.202  1.00   .00      VP1 
ATOM      3  N   GLY     6       8.420  50.899  85.486   .50 51.30      VP1 

% pdbcat -fields polio.pdb | awk '{$10 -= 31.0427; $11 -= 37.0688; 
          $12 -= 120.05; print }' | pdbcat | head -3 
ATOM      1 HT1  GLY     6     -22.083  12.959 -34.743  1.00  0.00      VP1    
ATOM      2 HT2  GLY     6     -22.131  14.402 -33.848  1.00  0.00      VP1    
ATOM      3 N    GLY     6     -22.623  13.830 -34.564  0.50 51.30      VP1    


Select all atoms within some distance of a certain position

In my case, I want the atoms withing 5 angstroms of the CA of SPH 

% grep SPH pdb2plv.pdb | grep CA
HETATM 6870  CA  SPH     0      33.929  52.255 115.739  1.00 51.30      2PLV7137
% pdbcat -fields pdb2plv.pdb | awk '($10-33.929)*($10-33.929)+($11-52.255)*
       ($11-52.255)+($12-115.739)*($12-115.739) < 5*5' | pdbcat
ATOM    839 CE2  TYR 1 112      30.226  50.647 118.178  1.00 26.17      2PLV   
ATOM   1594 CB   TYR 1 205      32.194  49.384 112.315  1.00 10.74      2PLV   
ATOM   1597 CD2  TYR 1 205      32.262  51.768 111.409  1.00 11.01      2PLV   
ATOM   1602 N    SER 1 206      35.177  48.403 113.360  1.00 12.89      2PLV
